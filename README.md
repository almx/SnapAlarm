SnapAlarm is a small reminder/alarm application for Windows.

Run it, and the app is placed in your system tray. Double-click the icon to create a new alarm, or right-click to see further options.

After creating an alarm, you can view it by right-clicking the tray icon and choosing "View Alarms". Double-click an alarm to edit it, or press Delete with an alarm selected in order to delete it.

Upon starting SnapAlarm, a file named SnapAlarm.Alarms.xml is create in the same directory as the executable - beware that UAC might whine about this.
